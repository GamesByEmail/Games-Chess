  <p>
    Dark Chess is a variant of traditional western Chess. All the pieces move in the same fashion. The differences are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A player is only able to see squares that their pieces are capable of moving to or attacking, hence the name
      Dark Chess.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no concept of 'check'. Because of the above limitation, a king may mot be able to see all of it's
      attackers. A player may make a move that results in their king being taken on the opponent's next move.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no concept of 'stalemate' because there is no check.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no concept of 'checkmate' because there is no check.
    </li>
    <li>
      Since there is no concept of 'check' or 'checkmate', the object of the game is to capture the opponent's king.
    </li>
  </ul>
